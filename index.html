   <h4>Taylor Dallin</h4> 

    This is my custom page that I have built from scratch. <br>
    This page has one sole purpose and that is to provide reasons as to why Football is the greatest sport on earth. <br>
    <br>
    <br>

    There are inumerable activities and sports in the world, however the one that tops them all is American Football. 
    What once started as a hobby, has now transformed itself into the greatest activity the world as ever seen. Full 
    of action, strategy, pain, anxious situations, trash talking, loud fans and more, there isn't anything else like it. 
    I have 3 main reasons as to why Football is the greatest sport on earth, each come with back up points to help 
    prove the main argument. Please continue reading and join yourself to the fandom of the greatest sport on earch. 

    <ol>
        <li id="edu"> Strategy
            <ul>
                <li>Every 20 seconds (after every play) a new strategy is formed and brough to the table in order to best the other side. 
                <li>Personell is switched out frequently in order to execute the best possbile play, and make the opposing Team
                    struggle to know who to guard and how to guard them. 
                </li>
            </ul> 
        </li>


        <li id="exp"> Violence and Physicality
                <ul>
                    <li>Every single play someone gets blown up by a block or a tackle</li>
                    <li>Arguably the biggest and most athletic men in the world line up face to face every single play and attack each other</li>
                </ul>


                
        <li id="ski"> Scoring Variety
                <ul>
                    <li>There are so many different ways that someone can score</li>
                    <li>Just because the offense scores, doesn't mean they get all the available points to them</li>
                    <li>You can score in all 3 phases of the game, each brings its own electric atmostphere and energy to the game</li>
                </ul>
